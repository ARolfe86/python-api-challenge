In this project, I created a Python script to visualize the weather in over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. A representative model of weather across cities was created from the data. A series of scattter plots were created to showcase the relationships between latitude and varying conditions. Then the linear regression was computed for each relationship and separated by the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

Additionally, for the second part of the project, I used the weather data to plan future vacations. A map was created to display a point for every city in the DataFrame. A new DataFrame called hotel_df was created to store the city, country, coordinates and humidity. For each city I used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates. A map was created to display the locations of the hotel and a hover message was added to each city on the map to display the hotel name and country.
